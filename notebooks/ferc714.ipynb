    "### Characterizing Unmapped Demand:\n",
    "* Calculate fraction of mapped vs. unmapped demand per year based on 2018 HIFLD geometries\n",
    "  * In 2018 as reported it's 88%\n",
    "  * By 2006 it's dropped to 58% \n",
    "* After hand assigning PacifiCorp and a couple of small co-ops their EIA utility IDs, the remaining respondents which lack `eia_code` values have no demand associated with them. So, yay!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrate Planning Area Descriptions\n",
    "* Given that all of the reported FERC 714 demand has an EIA entity of some kind associated with it, the task now is to see how those EIA entities can be hooked up with the county-level service areas reported in the EIA 861\n",
    "* Could also check to see how well they correspond to the utility IDs that are listed in the HIFLD 2018 utility service area and balancing area maps -- I'm starting to wonder if those are all ust amalgamations of counties based onthe EIA 861 data?\n",
    "* To check these FERC respondent associated `eia_code` values against the EIA 861 we need to get that data integrated into PUDL (at least extract and transform for a couple of tables).\n",
    "* Then, for each demand reporting FERC respondent, look up their `eia_code` in the service territory table. If it's not there, look it up in the Balancing Authority table (which goes away in 2013) and collect a list of constituent utilities from the balancing area table for which to grab county names out of the service area table.\n",
    "* Seems like this means creating a function that given an EIA Utility ID, goes and finds all the counties associated with it.\n",
    "* Then we need to map those state and county names to the FIPS county codes.\n",
    "* If there are any FERC respondents whose corresponding `eia_code` values show up in neither the BA or service territory tables of EIA 861, then we'll need to do the string matching (but why would a utility not show up in either of those?)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demand Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revise timezone assignments\n",
    "* Assuming all times are reported in \"standard\" time results in waaaay fewer duplicates.\n",
    "* All of these duplicates take place on January 1st.\n",
    "* Wondering if they are the result of reporting timezone changes from one year to another?\n",
    "* If this is a better setup, we can simply map the \"timezone\" abbreviations directly to their canonical timezones and skip the offset conversion phase.\n",
    "* Then we can take the report time, and the timezone, and combine them to create a new tz-naive UTC column and drop the original times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find broken data:\n",
    "* Run Tyler Ruggles' anomaly detection code as improved by Greg Schivley\n",
    "* What kind of anomalies are we finding? Are they a problem?\n",
