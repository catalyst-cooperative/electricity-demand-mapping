    "# Allocation of Demand based on Disaggregation and Re-aggregation of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to disaggregate demand from the FERC-714 dataset, based on the population from census data, then re-aggregating it to different various geometries like REEDs balancing areas, county-level, or at the state level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets and inputs used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FERC-714 form: Energy sales timeseries data for every planning area\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 2010 US Census data: Census tract geometries, and tract-level population and characteristics\n",

    "3. ReEDs balancing geometries: ReEDs geometries containing county level data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. US Planning Areas: Contains 97 planning area geometries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function to find intersection of the large and small geometries\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Function to normalize and redistribute from area to another attribute e.g. population\n",
